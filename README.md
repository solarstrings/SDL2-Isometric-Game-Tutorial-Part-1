Isometric Game Tutorial with SDL 2 - Part 1

I searched for some time after a good isometric tutorial to get me started, but only found some articles (which led me in the right direction). However, these did not cover picking tiles with cartesian coordinates (pick tiles just as you do on a square map), so I had to find that out myself, and here I share it with the rest of the world! Sharing is caring as they say! :) This tutorial serie is posted on www.indiegamedev.se, a swedish game development site. This tutorial covers: - 2 hours of coding, describing all steps. - Single layer map rendering - Smooth map scrolling - Mouse tile picking with cartesian screen coordinates - how to get smooth scrolling to work together with cartesian coordinate tile picking.
